# nTalesBot

I wanted to test out how telegram bots works, so I made this little bot that give you trivias of the given number through inline commands.

It should return the trivia options for the number and send it when the user chooses it.

### Usage

Start typing `@ntalesbot` in any chat and it will show what options you have for the desired number. It's a fair simple bot.
